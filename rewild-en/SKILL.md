name: rewild
description: Rewrite text that explicitly sounds AI-generated, robotic, or formulaic so it reads more naturally. Use only when the user explicitly wants to humanize or de-AI text with requests like "humanize this", "de-AI this", "remove AI tone", "sounds like ChatGPT", "clean up AI slop", or "rewild this". Do not trigger for generic proofreading, copyediting, grammar fixes, summarization, translation, or routine style polish unless the user clearly says the problem is AI-sounding text.

# Rewild

Remove AI-writing tells without turning the text into fiction, parody, or a personality transplant.

## Use / Do Not Use

Use this skill when the user explicitly frames the problem as:
- sounding like AI
- sounding robotic or generic
- needing to be "humanized" or "de-AI'd"

Do not use this skill for:
- normal proofreading or grammar cleanup
- translation
- summarization
- neutral copyediting
- routine tone adjustment when the user does not mention AI-sounding text

## Core Rules

- Preserve meaning. Rewrite style, not substance.
- Never invent facts, names, dates, metrics, quotes, anecdotes, or personal experience.
- Preserve quotes, citations, links, code, legal wording, regulated claims, and technical terms unless the user asks to rewrite them.
- Match the genre. Human does not mean casual.
- If the text already reads naturally, say so and make only the lightest useful pass.
- When the source is vague, make it cleaner and more honest. Do not fake specificity.

## Quick-Reference Checklist

Run this before delivering any rewritten text:

- Three consecutive sentences roughly the same length? Break one up
- Paragraph ends with a tidy one-liner? Vary the exit
- Dash before a reveal? Delete it
- Explaining a metaphor? Trust the reader
- "Additionally" / "Furthermore" / "Moreover"? Cut or replace with "and" / "but" / nothing
- Rule of three? Make it two or four
- No first person anywhere? Add "I" where the original stance supports it
- No proper nouns? Pull forward real names already in the source
- Every sentence starts Subject-Verb? Reorder one
- No questions asked? Add a rhetorical one if the genre supports it
- Zero sensory language? Add one concrete detail from the source
- No self-correction or uncertainty? Show a mind at work

## Personality and Soul

Avoiding AI patterns is only half the job. Sterile, voiceless writing is just as obvious as slop. Good writing has a human behind it.

Signs of soulless writing (even if technically "clean"):
- Every sentence is the same length and structure
- No opinions, just neutral reporting
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty or mixed feelings
- No first-person perspective when appropriate
- No humor, no edge, no personality
- Reads like a Wikipedia article or press release
- No sensory details, no names, no dates

How to add voice without fabricating:

Have opinions. "I genuinely don't know how to feel about this" is more human than neutrally listing pros and cons.

Vary your rhythm. Short punchy sentences. Then longer ones that take their time. Mix it up.

Acknowledge complexity. "This is impressive but also kind of unsettling" beats "This is impressive."

Use "I" when the original stance supports it. First person is not unprofessional.

Let some mess in. Asides and half-formed thoughts are human. Self-correct mid-thought. But do not add tangents that introduce new topics — mess means texture, not new substance.

Be specific about feelings. Not "this is concerning" but ground it in something real from the source.

Name things. Pull forward real names, places, and details already in the source text. Never invent specifics that are not there.

Think out loud. "Actually, wait — that's not quite right" is more human than a pre-polished paragraph.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: every detail you add must already exist in the source text or be obviously inferable from it. Do not invent meetings, anecdotes, statistics, company names, cities, or first-person experiences.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the problem is actually AI tone rather than grammar, structure, or domain accuracy.
2. Mark non-rewrite zones: quotes, citations, links, code, terms of art, precise numbers, and compliance-sensitive language.
3. Determine the genre and risk level.
4. Scan at least patterns 1-5 in [references/patterns.md](references/patterns.md). For stubborn AI tells, go deeper into the relevant category.
5. Rewrite only the lines that need it.
6. Run the quick-reference checklist.
7. Do a final pass for rhythm, specificity, and factual discipline.

## Genre Calibration

Informal writing:
- You can add warmth, sharper rhythm, and a clearer point of view.
- Use first person only if the original stance supports it.

Business writing:
- Remove hype and vague significance claims.
- Keep the register professional.

Technical documentation:
- Prioritize clarity, concrete examples, and precise terms.
- Do not inject personality for its own sake.

Academic writing:
- Remove promotion, vague attribution, and fake ranges.
- Keep the register formal and evidence-aware.

Legal, medical, support, and policy text:
- Be conservative.
- Accuracy, consistency, and traceability matter more than voice.

## Output

Provide:
1. The rewritten text
2. An optional short note naming the main AI-writing patterns removed

Rewilded text is typically shorter than the original because AI writing is padded. Do not add filler to match the original length.

Only score the result if the user asks for scoring.

## Quality Scoring (on request)

Rate the rewritten text on a 1-10 scale across 5 dimensions (total out of 50):

| Dimension | What to measure | Score |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Directness | States facts or tells a story around them? 10: cuts straight to it; 1: preamble everywhere | /10 |
| Rhythm | Sentence lengths varied? 10: short/long mix; 1: metronomic uniformity | /10 |
| Trust | Respects the reader's intelligence? 10: concise; 1: over-explains everything | /10 |
| Authenticity | Sounds like a real person? 10: natural, opinionated, specific; 1: robotic, generic | /10 |
| Precision | Uses exact words, names, numbers? 10: no filler; 1: vague abstractions | /10 |
| Total | | /50 |

45-50: Excellent. 35-44: Good, room for more personality. Below 35: Needs another pass.

## Full Worked Example

Before (AI-sounding):
> The new software update serves as a testament to the company's commitment to innovation. Moreover, it introduces batch processing, keyboard shortcuts, and offline mode, providing a seamless, intuitive, and powerful user experience — ensuring that users can accomplish their goals efficiently. It's not just an update, it's a revolution in how we think about productivity. Industry experts believe this will have a lasting impact on the entire sector.

After (rewritten):
> The update adds batch processing, keyboard shortcuts, and offline mode — the three features that matter. Not a revolution. Just a good update that does what people actually asked for.

Changes made:
- Removed "serves as a testament" (inflated symbolism, pattern 1)
- Removed "Moreover" (AI vocabulary, pattern 11)
- Removed "seamless, intuitive, and powerful" (adjective triplet + promotional, patterns 14, 2)
- Removed em-dash-ensuring construction (superficial -ing, pattern 7)
- Removed "It's not just...it's..." (negative parallelism, pattern 13)
- Removed "Industry experts believe" (vague attribution, pattern 3)
- Pulled forward the three concrete features already in the source (fixes pattern 9)
